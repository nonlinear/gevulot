# v0.1.0 - Development Environment

## App Development Stack

Cross-platform: React Native or Flutter. VS Code for development, Xcode for iOS builds/signing/TestFlight, Android Studio only for final packaging.

## Distribution & Risk

iOS requires Apple Developer Account, app review, TestFlight for beta.

**Reality check:** App can delete or rewrite contacts. This is dangerous. Must be explicitly communicated as part of the game rules and accepted knowingly.

## iOS vs Android — Contact Permissions

### Android

Single permission (`READ_CONTACTS` / `WRITE_CONTACTS`) grants full read/edit/create access. Coarse-grained but powerful.

### iOS

More restrictive. Permissions are explicit and revocable. App must break if permissions are denied. Game rule: if you don't grant permissions, you can't play.
